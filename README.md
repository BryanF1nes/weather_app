# Weather App

Weather APP application utilizing the free `weapther api` resource and integrating TDD practices.

## Tech stack

Jest, Webpack, CSS, JS, TS, Weather API

### Description

For this project I wanted to take a different approach than simply connnecting to the weather API and fetching the data.
With this APP I wanted to first utilize TDD to get the basic functionality working. Then using only JS and TS I would flesh
out the app using only the `#root div` within my HTML template.

### Live site

Live Preview will be integrated here -

#### TODO:

- [x] Integrate TDD for fetching data to the `weather api`.

- [ ] Basic skeleton site using HTML.
- [ ] Flesh out skeleton site using JS/TS.
